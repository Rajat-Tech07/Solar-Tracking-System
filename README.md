Intelligent Solar Tracking System

-- Overview
    This project optimizes solar panel orientation by continuously tracking the sun using dual LDR sensors and a servo motor.  
    It increases solar power generation efficiency by ensuring the panel always faces maximum sunlight.

-- Features
    Dual-LDR light comparison  
    Automatic servo-based orientation  
    Increased power capture  
    Simple, low-cost design  
    Arduino/NodeMCU compatible  

-- Hardware Required
    2 × LDR sensors  
    2 × 10kΩ resistors  
    SG90/Servo motor  
    Arduino/NodeMCU  
    Jumper wires  
    Solar panel mount
  
-- Working Principle
    1. LDR1 and LDR2 measure light intensity  
    2. Microcontroller compares the values  
    3. If difference > error margin → servo rotates  
    4. Panel aligns toward maximum intensity  

-- Conclusion
    A simple yet powerful system that increases solar efficiency using low-cost hardware and smart automation.
